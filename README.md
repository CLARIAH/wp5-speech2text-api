# wp5-speech2text-api


This API interfaces with the [scripts](https://github.com/beeldengeluid/spraakherkenning) provided by Laurens van der Werff, which in turn uses KALDI (see http://opensource-spraakherkenning.nl/)


## Requirements

This API is built using Python 2.7, [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) and [FlaskRESTful](http://flask-restful-cn.readthedocs.org/en/0.3.4/).

[Swagger](http://swagger.io/) (most likely) will be used to provide the documentation.

## Status

Currently the API is being worked on. The source code will be added in the upcoming month.
